Suggest better implementation plan:

I guess UCB1 would be a better alternative because it offers a more principled way to balance 
exploration and exploitation. Unlike Epsilon-Greedy, which explores randomly and relies on carefully 
tuning the epsilon value, UCB1 uses confidence bounds to make smarter, data-driven exploration decisions. 
This means it naturally shifts from exploring uncertain arms to exploiting the best ones as more 
information is gathered. Compared to Thompson Sampling, UCB1 is deterministic and doesnâ€™t require any prior 
distributions or sampling from posteriors, which makes it simpler to implement and easier to interpret. 
It also provides strong theoretical guarantees, like logarithmic regret over time, which makes it a reliable 
choice in stationary environments. Overall, it seems like a cleaner and more efficient strategy, especially 
when we want good performance without relying on randomness or tuning.
